#  
# cv is cases in the vaccine group
# nv is the number in the vaccine group
# 
# cc is cases in the control group 
# nc is number in the ctonrol group
# 
#  Numbers below are from studies largely or entirely in target age range (2-15 years)
#  Only include studies in right age range (2-15_  and where children under 9 receive either two doses , 
# or one  dose if vaccinated the previous year
# Data are from 
# i) Belshe 1998: Chidlren aged 15 months to 71 months (mean age about 40 months). Use two dose per porotocl results. 
# ii) Belshe 2000: children aged 26 to o 85 months (mean age about 50 months). All revaccinated. (so previously vaccinated)
# Do not include Klick et al Vaccine 2013 as  no children received two doses of seasonal vaccine
 # (in first year only pandemic vaccine was used).
 # Do not include Vesikari 2006 or Tam  2007 as median age is less than 2

# Results below are from per protocol analysis where outcome is any confirmed influenza case.
# [per protocol seems most relevant, as the model accounts for the fact that not everyone receives the vaccine - 
# and the parameter estimates are for those who do receive the vaccine]
